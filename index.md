# Deep Learning Projects - Computer Vision

Thanks for visiting my website. Here I have listed Healthcare related problems and their solutions using state of the art algorithm. You can find working software code
using 2D CNN, 3D CNN, Temporal-Spation detection etc. Wishing you a very happy learning

## Anomaly Detection

> The Model has been trained using 20k+ actual images from Path Lab
The Model provides an accuracy of around 90% in terms of detecting Anomaly after running detection on Dicom images

## Surgical Phase Detection

The Surgical Phase detection model has been trained by using Real time surgical videos and uses state of the Art algorithms i.e. Spatio-Temporal (3D CNN, LSTM Model, MTCNN). The Model can detect the current Surgical Phase with an accuracy of 92%
